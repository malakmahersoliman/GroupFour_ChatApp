 How to Compile & Run the App
===============================

1. Open Terminal and go to the project folder:
   cd "/path/to/GroupFour_ChatApp"    # location where you cloned it

2. Compile the program (make sure to include all source files and headers):
   g++ -I include main.cpp src/*.cpp -o chatapp

3. Run the program:
   ./chatapp

 Notes
===============================
- Make sure you have all the following files in the "src" folder:
    User.cpp
    Message.cpp
    Chat.cpp
    PrivateChat.cpp
    GroupChat.cpp
    WhatsApp.cpp

- The "include" folder must contain the corresponding header (.h) files:
    User.h
    Message.h
    Chat.h
    PrivateChat.h
    GroupChat.h
    WhatsApp.h

- The file "main.cpp" must be in the main project folder (same level as the src and include folders).

- Always compile using the `-I include` flag so the compiler can find your header files.
